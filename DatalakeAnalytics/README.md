## Batch Analytics with Data Lake Analytics Service

![Header Image](images/datalakeanalytics.png)

Process big data jobs in seconds with Azure Data Lake Analytics. There is no infrastructure to worry about because there are no servers, virtual machines, or clusters to wait for, manage, or tune. Instantly scale the processing power, measured in Azure Data Lake Analytics Units (AU), from one to thousands for each job. You only pay for the processing that you use per job.

U-SQL is a simple, expressive, and extensible language that allows you to write code once and have it automatically parallelized for the scale you need. Process petabytes of data for diverse workload categories such as querying, ETL, analytics, machine learning, machine translation, image processing, and sentiment analysis by leveraging existing libraries written in .NET languages, R, or Python.

In this lab Learn how to 

* use Data Lake Analytics to run big data analysis jobs that scale to massive data sets
* how to create and manage batch, real-time, and interactive analytics jobs, and 
* how to query using the U-SQL language
